<!-- Original code uses target="_blank" inside the ahref, search suggests that it specifies where to open, however it opens without it in a new tab... added rel code per Alex's (the CEO and founder of jitbit) suggestion that phishing may be used with the target="_blank" code, due to redirect. Also suggested that anytime you would use window.open(); you're vulnerable, so reset the opener property with 
var newWnd = window.open();
newWnd.opener = null; -->
